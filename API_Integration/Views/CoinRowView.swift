/* CoinRowView (UI Component/View):
 Purpose: Displays a single row of data for a cryptocurrency in the user interface.
 Type: It is responsible for rendering the display of a Coin object in a list or table format.
 Example: A CoinRowView would take a Coin as input and display its relevant details (e.g., symbol, price, and market cap) in a UI element like a List or VStack in SwiftUI.
 Usage: This view is responsible for presenting the UI to the user. You might use it to show multiple Coin objects in a list, where each row represents one cryptocurrency and displays its data.
