/* Coin (Data Model):
Purpose: Represents a single cryptocurrencyâ€™s data.
Type: This model contains the actual data fetched from the API for a specific coin.

Example: A Coin struct would include properties such as:
symbol ((e.g., "BTC" for Bitcoin))
name (e.g., "Bitcoin")
price (the current price of the coin)
marketCap (the total market capitalization)
volume24h (the 24-hour trading volume)
Usage: This data model is used to store the raw data fetched from an API, which you can then manipulate and display in the app.
